				<div class="back2">E-Governance in Nepal has steadily evolved from computerization of Government Departments to initiatives that encapsulate the finer points of Governance, such as citizen centricity, service orientation and transparency. Lessons from previous e-Governance initiatives have played an important role in shaping the progressive e-Governance strategy of the country. Due cognizance has been taken of the notion that to speed up e-Governance implementation across the various arms of Government at National and Local levels, a programme approach needs to be adopted, guided by common vision and strategy. This approach has the potential of enabling huge savings in costs through sharing of core and support infrastructure, enabling interoperability through standards, and of presenting a seamless view of Government to citizens.

				e-Governance Master Plan (e-GMP) takes a holistic view of e-Governance initiatives across the country, integrating them into a collective vision, a shared cause. Around this idea, a massive countrywide infrastructure reaching down to the remotest of villages is evolving, and large-scale digitization of records is taking place to enable easy, reliable access over the internet. The ultimate objective is to bring public services closer home to citizens, as articulated in the Vision Statement of eGMP.

				"Make all Government services accessible to the common man in his locality, through common service delivery outlets, and ensure efficiency, transparency, and reliability of such services at affordable costs to realise the basic needs of the common man"</div>

On his visit to the far-west state to observe the damage caused by floods and landslides, PM Deuba mentioned that the MCC was subject to Nepal’s interest. “The MCC will be endorsed. And I don’t see anything that needs amendment. Fake news and disinformation about MCC have been widespread,” said PM Deuba.
				He said that the MCC was nothing more than a grand, claiming that some are trying to create chaos around the MCC endorsement. The MCC Nepal compact is just a development grant, he said adding, “Why should Nepal reject such generous support?”. Meanwhile, PM Deuba promised to provide short-term and long-term relief packages for flood victims and draft reconstruction plans in the eastern and western regions.</div>
